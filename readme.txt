An epolice-complaint website must basically have these things :
    An email and mobile otp based login - for extra authenticity
    An interface to mention the details of the complaint and an option to select from the common complaints list
    what was the issue
    where did it happen
    a database integration for all the filed complaints
    databse must have full_name, mobile_number, complaint_type, date, place, details_about_the_complaint
    also an anonymous chat or interface to inform about confidential crimes(drug deals, whereabouts of someone etc)
